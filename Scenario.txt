---- Why we need TS ?
   - Improve dev experience.
   - Easy to debug
   - More descriptive than JS. ex - we know the datatypes which overall improves redaiblity.
   - Is to maintain
   - To much to write compared to JS.

---- Datatyes in TS / JS 
   - number -> example : 11, 12 , -12312, 12341314 , 0
   - string -> example : "EKCS" , 'EKCS', `EKCS` (this is called template literal)
   - boolean -> example : true , false
   - void -> Void is a return type, (Means it is used on function to denote that the fucntion won't return any value )
   - any -> You can use this to automatically detect the type of a data.


---- Functions, parameter and Return type
   - void 
   - any
   - other general datatype

---- Linear Search (What , How to Implement )
---- [10,234,1,23423,132401,123,34] -> sort this array using for loops only (30min) if not understood search -- Selection Sort.
